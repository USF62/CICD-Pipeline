# CI/CD Pipeline
"The CI/CD pipeline is a group of practices known as continuous integration, continuous delivery and continuous deployment. Often used by DevOps teams, the CI/CD pipeline is a method that builds, tests and deploys code by using automation. The impact of this type of pipeline includes more frequent and reliable updates to software and applications and a more collaborative, agile workflow for DevOps teams." - <a href="https://www.ibm.com/cloud/blog/ci-cd-pipeline">IBM Definition</a>

This project will address the “behind-the-scenes” for most app development processes in companies along with popular technologies used in the industry that students do not usually learn about early in their career. The benefits of this project will provide an understanding and exposure for early industry professionals and non-technical professionals about app development from implementation to deployment infrastructure.
